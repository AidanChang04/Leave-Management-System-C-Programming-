1. Eligibility: The leave management system is only available to faculty and staff members of the university who are authorized to take leave. Students are not eligible to use this system.

2. Leave Types: The system supports various types of leaves, including annual leave, compassionate leave, emergency leave, maternity leave, and medical leave types as per the university policy. If you would like to apply for a paternity leave, please visit the admin or email the admin via admin@apu.edu.my.

3. Approval Process: All leave requests must be approved by the appropriate authority. The system will route the request to the relevant person for approval based on the type of leave and the length of absence.

4. Accrual and Balance: The system will automatically calculate the balance and accrual of leaves based on the type of leave. Faculty and staff members can view their leave balances and history in the system.

5. Leave Cancellation: Faculty and staff members can cancel their leave requests in the system before the leave start date. However, cancellation of leave requests after the start date will not be allowed.

6. Record Keeping: The system maintains an accurate record of all leave transactions, including leave requests, approvals, rejections, and cancellations. However, if a leave is cancelled and is reapplied, and the user wishes to modify the status of the leave, the first leave that was cancelled should be deleted first, and this can only be carried out by the staff.

7. Misuse of the System: Misuse of the leave management system, including falsifying leave records or approving one's leave request, may result in disciplinary action.

8. Availability and Support: The leave management system is available 24/7, except during scheduled maintenance. Technical support is available during business hours.
